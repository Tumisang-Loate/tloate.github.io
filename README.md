## About me

I'm a macroeconomist seeking to understand the effect of fiscal and monetary policy in an unequal society

My research seeks to answer the following two questions: What are the macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy? And what are the effects of monetary policy in an unequal society with a heterogenous banking and household sector?

I seek to answer these questions mainly using the empirical approach.
